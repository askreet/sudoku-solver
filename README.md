# Sudoku Solver

This application is a visualization of an algorithm that solves Sudoku puzzles.
The main challenge in creating this application was having a list of steps taken
by the algorithm that could be presented to the user. I wanted to be able to have
a learner step through how the algorithm solves the problem, not simply return
the result.
